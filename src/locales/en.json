With technologies constantly evolving and new tools emerging, I saw the need to learn them as soon as possible to adapt and advance in my projects. So, I began taking additional courses, some out of curiosity and others to prepare myself for projects I wanted to be part of. These certificates reflect the evolution of my learning."
